      <div>
        In order to minimize drama and maximize success the following criteria should be met by a loot-system:
        <ul>
          <li>Fairness</li>
          <li>Reliability</li>
          <li>Simplicity</li>
          <li>Flexibility</li>
          <li>Transparency</li>
        </ul>
        What should also be considered is the fact that it shouldn't in any way, shape nor form be able to be abused by neither a single individual nor a group
        of people. Here is a list of commonly used loot-systems, how they work and what their strengths and weaknesses are:

        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">Loot-council</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          A select group of people, generally officers and the GM, decide who get what item based solely on their opinions. This system CAN be extremely fair,
          reliable and flexible but runs a high risk of being abused by previously mentioned people. And even if it is not abused the transparency will always
          be an issue due to the simple fact that individual members have no way of discerning where they currently stand as far as loot goes. Another issue is
          the simplicity, it demands A LOT of work in order to be properly executed.
        </div>
        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">Suicide Kings</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          A system where every member is sorted in a big list where the highest person will get whichever item they so desire (within limits of course). As soon
          as said item is awarded they drop down to last place and have to wait until they are at, or close to, the top to receive an item again. The biggest
          weakness of this is the flexibility and reliability. There is also the problem with fairness where it can easily be abused without any reprimand.
        </div>
        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">DKP</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          Killing bosses award attending members with DKP (Dragon Killing Points) and said points are spent to either buy or bid for items that drop.
          Transparency and fairness is usually not a problem with DKP however it is not always so flexible and reliable. It can unfortunately easily be abused
          by simply hoarding DKP. Where it falls other than that is generally that it has some side-effects such as inflation/deflation and in either of those
          cases it makes the system unfair either for or against new members that join in the middle of a raid-tier.
        </div>
        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">FFA</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          Not an alternative given the criteria listed above.
        </div>
        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">Need/Greed</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          Simply rolling on items that drop that are appropriate for class/spec. Now this system is undoubtedly simple, reliable and transparent but it falls
          extremely short in flexibility and fairness. Leaving loot up to luck of the draw will undoubtedly lead to some extremely unhappy individuals who
          happen upon unlucky streaks.
        </div>
        <div class="loot-section__subtitle">EPGP</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          EPGP stands for Effort Points/Gear Points and is a system that is most closely related to DKP. But instead of simply using points as a currency it
          instead gives a value which in turn is used to decide who gets which item. It also factors in a weekly decay which has two main functions: limiting
          the possibility for individual players to hoard points and keeping all players within a set margin of points. The way the points are tracked can be
          viewed by anyone and the number of ways to earn EP can be customizable to fit any need. At first the system might seem confusing or even convoluted
          but it is extremely easy to maintain and control. The system itself also allows for easy handling of new members and the effect they have on an
          already started tier.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="epgp" class="loot-section">
      <div class="modal-title">2. EPGP</div>
      <div>
        Taking the information above into account we have decided to use EPGP as our tool to monitor the efforts of our members and distribution of items that
        drop in raids. We feel it meets the criterias stated above to the fullest extent and will lead to an enviroment everyone can enjoy.
        <div id="epgp__how-it-works" class="loot-section__subtitle">2.1 How it works</div>
        <div class="loot-section__text">
          As previously mentioned EP/GP stands for Effort Points / Gear Points. The way members accumulate EP can be through a multitude of ways. Such as being
          inside the instance when the raid-time starts, standing at the ready to jump in if needed or simply by killing bosses. GP on the other hand is awarded
          when choosing to take a piece of loot. Different pieces have a different value so the better the item the more GP.<br /><br />
          The next step in the process is to simply divide your current EP with your current GP, the result of this is your priority for future drops. The
          higher the number the higher your priority. You then compare the priority of all members asking for a specifik drop and whoever has the highest gets
          said item.<br /><br />
          Example: <br />
          An item drops that costs 60 GP. Both Alpha and Beta wants the item and both are eligable to have it. To see who gets it we have to compare their
          priority:
          <ul>
            <li>Alphas Effort Points (from doing various things) are 240</li>
            <li>Alphas Gear Points (from taking a few items previously) are 120</li>
            <li>240 / 120 = 2</li>
            <li>Thus Alphas priority is 2</li>
            <li>Betas Effort Points (from doing various things) are 260</li>
            <li>Betas Gear Points (from taking a few items previously) are 180</li>
            <li>260 / 180 = 1.4</li>
            <li>Thus Betas priority is 1.4</li>
            <li>
              Alphas priority is higher which means he/she gets the item. After the item is awarded Alphas new priority is (240/180=) 1.3 and that means that
              Beta will get the next item (as long as no one with a higher priority wants that item).
            </li>
          </ul>
          As you can tell the longer between each item you have gotten, the higher your priority will be and sooner or later yours will be higher than those you
          compete against.<br /><br />
          So what happens if two people have the same priority? The system will automatically do a roll for each player choosing that they are interested in the
          item. These rolls can then be compared and whoever rolled highest wins the item. This will happen a lot in the beginning but the further we get the
          fewer times it will have to be resorted to.
        </div>

        <div class="modal-title">3. Effort Points (EP)</div>
        <div>
          The way in which we will be tracking each individual members dedication, commitment and diligence is through Effort Points. If you show up for raids,
          come prepared and stay the course you will undoubtedly be awarded for it. The gaining of EP is your way of making sure you will get loot, which in
          turn will make your character and the whole guild stronger.

          <div class="loot-section__text">
            EP will be awarded to members through these means:
            <ul>
              <li>Being inside the raid and at the ready 18.30</li>
              <li>Having a food-buff up when we do the first pull</li>
              <li>Killing every boss</li>

              <li>Staying throughout the entire raid</li>
              <li>
                Being ready to step in if the raid is full. Ready means either logged out just outside the raid and sitting available on Discord or being online
                in-game and farming/idling.

        <div class="modal-title">4. Gear Points (GP)</div>
        <div>
          The manner in which you track how “much” gear a single individual has gotten is through Gear Points. The amount of GP a specific piece costs is
          determined by a number of factors and this is to make sure different items cost different amounts depending on their worth. A 2 Handed Epic Sword
          should definitively cost more than a Rare Ring, and an Epic ring from a later Tier should cost more than an Epic Ring from a Lower one.
          <div id="gear-points__formula" class="loot-section__subtitle">4.1 Formula</div>
          <div class="loot-section__text">
            The formula used in order to determine an items GP is as follows:<br /><br />
            0,483 x (2^((ilvl/26)+(rarity-4)) x slot) x 1<br /><br />
            ILVL: Fixed depending on the stats on the item, it is an easy way to value items from different Tiers against each other. Generally all items from a
            raid have a similar ilvl with the exception being the last boss that tends to drop items with a higher ilvl.<br /><br />
            Rarity: Will not be relevant on very many occasions but should absolutely be taken into account. It is only regarded by two formulas:
            <ul>
              <li>Rare: TBD</li>
              <li>Epic: TBD</li>
            </ul>
            Slot: The last variable part of the equation is slots. It is important for different slots to cost different amounts due to the shear value. A
            Chestpiece is a lot more worth than Bracers for example.
            <ul>
              <li>Head: 1</li>
              <li>Neck: 0.5</li>
              <li>Shoulder: 0.75</li>
              <li>Cloak: 0.5</li>
              <li>Chest: 1</li>
              <li>Wrist: 0.5</li>
              <li>Hands: 0.75</li>
              <li>Waist: 0.75</li>
              <li>Legs: 1</li>
              <li>Feet: 0.75</li>
              <li>Ring: 0.5</li>
              <li>Trinket: 0.75</li>
              <li>1H Weapon: 1.25</li>
              <li>2H Weapon: 2/0.5*</li>
              <li>Shield: 0.5</li>
              <li>Ranged: 0.5/2*</li>
              <li>Wand: 0,5</li>
              <li>Relic: 0.5</li>
              <li>Thrown: 0.5</li>
              <li>Caster OH: 0.5</li>
            </ul>
            *Example of exceptions, more below.<br /><br />
            Reasoning behind weapons:<br /><br />
            The biggest point of discussion is without a doubt the disparities between using two 1-H, a 1-H and OH or a 2H. These costs don't match up, instead
            they fall on increments om 1.75, 2 and 2.5. The reasoning behind this is as follows:<br /><br />
            There is no doubt that one of the most sought out upgrades is weapons for melee. This due to the added value of not simply being used for the base
            stats. The DPS is paramount for melee. As a result the heavily contested 1-H will have to be tolled with quite a price. The question that might
            arise then is: “Why doesn't 2-H cost the same price? It has the same added effect.”. The answer is that there just isn't the same type of desire for
            those weapons. There is also the added effect of having two enchantments etc. As far as casters go there is a lot of simplicity in taking a Staff.
            While taking a MH and OH requires more effort. Thus the 0.25 difference.<br /><br />
            This is by no means perfect but it doesn't put any one group in a too good/bad of a position.
          </div>
          <div id="gear-points__exceptions" class="loot-section__subtitle">4.2 Exceptions</div>
          <div class="loot-section__text">
            Now there are a few exceptions when it comes to GP. This is to help relieve some of the problems that could arise if the system is too rigid. These
            exceptions are all made in order to make gearing as smooth and fair as possible while also making sure we have the best possibilities to progress.
          </div>
          <div id="gear-points__exceptions__ranged" class="loot-section__subtitle">4.2.1 Ranged/2-Handers</div>
          <div class="loot-section__text">
            The first exception to general cost-rules are Ranged Weapons and 2-Handed Weapons for Melee/Hunters. For Hunters a 2-Handed Weapon will have a
            coefficient of 0,5 and Ranged Weapons 2,0. The opposite is true for Melee: a 2-Handed Weapon will have a coefficient of 2,0 and Ranged Weapons 0,5.
            But not only that, due to the imbalance this might cause Melee will automatically have a priority for 2-Handed Weapons and Hunters for Ranged. This
            is to make sure items that are simply used as stat-sticks won't cost too much, and Main Weapons won't cost too little.
          </div>
          <div id="gear-points__exceptions__tanking" class="loot-section__subtitle">4.2.2 Tanking</div>
          <div class="loot-section__text">
            The next exception has to do with DPS-Warriors and Tanking Gear. As per usual Tanks have a priority on all Tanking items, and the Main Tank
            specifically. This makes sure that the people who have to be hit in the face and survive do just that; survive. But what happens when designated
            Tanks have the loot they need? Then said items will be handed to other Warriors free of charge. Why? Well it is quite simple, without properly
            geared tanks we will not succeed and getting far enough they will be required (looking at you 4-H). Thus it is one of the few positions where you
            really don't have an option. A Healer doesn't HAVE to take items for DPS, neither do the designated Tanks. And should our DPS have to gimp their
            position in order to accomodate a forced need? Not really. Thus left-over pieces of gear for tanking will be handed out.
          </div>
          <div id="gear-points__exceptions__legendary" class="loot-section__subtitle">4.2.3 Thunderfury and Atiesh</div>
          <div class="loot-section__text">
            The last exception will be Thunderfury and Atiesh. Now these items will not be handed out on a whim, nor based on who just happened to be on top of
            the priority. These items will have to be decided before they drop. As far as Thunderfury is concerned it will undoubtedly go to the Main Tank first
            and to other Tanks thereafter. This is bescause of the insane threat-increase it provides for the tanks, which in turn makes life easier for
            everyone else. Atiesh is still to be determined.

        <div class="modal-title">5. Decay</div>
        <div>
          EPGP has a built in tool in order to minimize the risk, or at least punish the act, of hoarding. This is done through a decay. At a fixed interval, in
          this case every Wednesday, 5% of every members EP and GP will be deducted. This means that everyones priority will stay the same but the overall
          point-difference will be decreased. The decay then also fill an important role of making sure long-time raiders still have all the reason to attend
          raids. Sure your EP goes down but so does your GP and thus raiding again will increase your EP while not taking loot will keep your priority high.
          This leads us into the next point: changing of raid-tiers. When a new tier of 40-man raiding is introduced we will have a forced decay of 40%. This is
          done in order to soft-reset the system but still make sure that dedicated people get a priority on loot.

        <div>
          As a line in new raids becoming available the old ones will shift over to becoming somewhat redundant. There are however a few reasons why it is still
          important to run the old raids:
          <ul>
            <li>BiS-items for certain classes/specs</li>
            <li>Thunderfury</li>
            <li>Crafting mats</li>
            <li>General upgrades</li>
          </ul>
          To make sure the items in said raids don't simply get DE’d because people don't want to waste their priority on them a discount will be enforced. TBD

          As we progress the perfect scenario would be that we keep the exact same lineup throughout, and we will always strive to keep everyone in the guild
          happy, content and involved. However sometimes things happen and new members will have to be recruited. There will probably never exist a solution to
          loot and new members that will please everyone but hopefully our option will be a middle ground that everyone can accept. To make sure new members get
          a worthwhile introduction, and still make sure our long-time members don't feel bypassed, we will have a minimum requirement of EP in order to get
          loot. This requirement should equate to approximately 2-3 weeks of raiding. Then they are allowed to use their priority to take loot in front of
          others. It should be noted that receiving loot is still an option, however this is strictly for gear that should otherwise be DE’d.

          First of all: thank you for taking on this wall of text. The whole point of it is to make everyone’s stay within the guild easier. Seeing as the
          biggest breaker of guilds, apart from poor management or lack of progress, is loot-related this compendium should hopefully nip those issues in the
          bud. If you have any questions or other ideas feel free to raise them with any of the Loot-Managers. The whole point is to have a high ceiling where
          everyone can make their voice heard. That said, opinions may very well be from one end of the spectrum to another and these guidelines lays the
